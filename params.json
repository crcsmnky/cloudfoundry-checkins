You'll also need to download and start MongoDB if you're planning to develop this thing locally. If you want to push the app to Cloud Foundry, you'll need an account there and the `vmc` tools.\r\n\r\nGet the app\r\n\r\n    $ git clone http://github.com/crcsmnky/cloudfoundry-checkins.git\r\n    $ cd cloudfoundry-checkins\r\n    $ npm install -d\r\n\r\nDownload and install MongoDB\r\n[http://www.mongodb.org/downloads](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads).\r\n\r\nStart the app\r\n\r\n    $ node app.js\r\n\r\nAnd checkin like crazy\r\n\r\n    $ curl -d \"comment=hello world\" -d \"lat=50&lon=50\" http://localhost:3000/checkin\r\n\r\nTo push the app to Cloud Foundry, [install the Cloud Foundry CLI](http://start.cloudfoundry.com/tools/vmc/installing-vmc.html) and [deploy an app](http://start.cloudfoundry.com/tools/deploying-apps.html).\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThis is just a *really* simple app I built to go along with my talk about MongoDB at the [Cloud Foundry Open Tour](http://opentour.cloudfoundry.com/2012/austin) in Austin on April 5th.","google":"","name":"cloudfoundry-checkins","tagline":"A frighteningly simple checkin app that can be deployed on Cloud Foundry"}
